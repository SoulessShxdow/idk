`UserHttpRequestsPerMinuteLimit` is a dynamic fast integer variable defined in the `HttpService` class to control the rate at which HTTP requests can be made. Here's an explanation of its role and implementation:

### **Purpose**
The primary purpose of `UserHttpRequestsPerMinuteLimit` is to:
1. **Throttle HTTP Requests**: Prevent abuse or excessive network usage by limiting the number of requests a user can make within a minute.
2. **Ensure Stability**: Protect the backend servers and other infrastructure from being overwhelmed by too many HTTP requests from a single user or game session.
3. **Encourage Efficient Use**: Motivate developers to use HTTP calls judiciously by working within the limit.

### **Definition and Configuration**
```cpp
DYNAMIC_FASTINTVARIABLE(UserHttpRequestsPerMinuteLimit, 500)
```

- **Dynamic**: The `DYNAMIC_FASTINTVARIABLE` macro means this variable's value can be changed dynamically at runtime without requiring a recompilation or restart of the application.
- **Default Value**: It is initialized with a default value of `500`, allowing 500 requests per minute.
- **Global Scope**: This variable likely exists at a global level and can be accessed or modified through Roblox's configuration systems or tools.

### **Integration in the Code**
The `UserHttpRequestsPerMinuteLimit` is used via a `throttle` object in the `HttpService` constructor:
```cpp
HttpService::HttpService() :
    httpEnabled(false),
    throttle(&DFInt::UserHttpRequestsPerMinuteLimit)
{
    setName(sHttpService);
}
```

#### Throttling in Action
The `checkEverything` method incorporates the throttle to enforce the limit:
```cpp
if (!throttle.checkLimit())
{
    errorFunction("Number of requests exceeded limit");
    return false;
}
```

- **Throttle Object**: This is an abstraction that keeps track of how many requests have been made and determines whether the current request exceeds the allowed limit.
- **Error Reporting**: If the limit is exceeded, the request is denied, and an error message (`"Number of requests exceeded limit"`) is passed to the provided error handling function.

### **Benefits**
1. **Configurable at Runtime**: Administrators can adjust the limit without modifying the source code, allowing flexibility based on server load or requirements.
2. **Controlled Resource Usage**: Prevents any single game or user from consuming disproportionate resources.
3. **Developer Awareness**: Encourages game developers to design systems that respect rate limits.

### **Use Case Example**
If the `UserHttpRequestsPerMinuteLimit` is set to `500`, each game server can make up to 500 HTTP requests per minute using `HttpService`. If a developer tries to exceed this limit:
- The throttle detects this and blocks the additional requests.
- An error message informs the developer of the exceeded limit, allowing them to take corrective action (e.g., reduce request frequency).
